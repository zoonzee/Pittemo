// This class provides timer functionality for events.  A timer can be created which has
// an interval at which is fires the supplied selector within the supplied target.  It 
// can also just file each game cycle without the use of an interval.
// Timers are used within the EventScheduling class which is where all event timers are 
// both scheduled and unscheduled.

// Returns a timer instance which has been configured with the supplied target and selector.
// The returned timer does not have an interval and will be fired on each game logic cycle.
// The selector which is fired will be passed the |delta| allowing the called selector to 
// use the elapsed time as necessary.  The returned timer will continue to file until it is 
// manually unscheduled through the EventScheduler.  The timer returned is marked for autorelease
// and it is therefore the responsibility of the caller to retain it.

// This method is used to update this timer.  When called it will check to see if the timer should
// fire based on the interval which has been defined.  If it should fire then the configured selector
// is called within the configured target.
