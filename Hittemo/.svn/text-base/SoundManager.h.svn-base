// SoundManager provides a basic wrapper for OpenAL and AVAudioPlayer.  It is a singleton
// class that allows sound clips to be loaded and cached with a key and then played back
// using that key.  It also allows for music tracks to be played, stopped and paused
//
// This sound engine class has been created based on the OpenAL tutorial at
// http://benbritten.com/blog/2008/11/06/openal-sound-on-the-iphone/
